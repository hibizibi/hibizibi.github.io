### Goal
This site is organized in chapters of random things that I am experimenting with.
I would like to take rendom notes to log the journey so that I can come back to this for the shortcuts.
### Steps
I would create small scenarios that will help me learn each thing that will fit to a larger goal.
### Objective
- Using Gitlab CI/CD to deploy Terraform Configurations in AWS
- Goal:
   - Terraform - basic (module,variable,providor)
   -  GitLab Pipeline
- Resources:
   - [Terraform ci-cd](https://bmwitcher.medium.com/using-gitlab-ci-cd-to-deploy-terraform-configurations-in-aws-d13a74a6fa47)
   - [Deploy Hugo with Terraform](https://blog.mehdilaruelle.ninja/posts/)
      
### Pre-req

1. Build the simplest website (static)
2. Move that from static to API
3. Next, with db
 
- Create terraform and deploy it to aws (manually)
   - I need a aws account (creating new one)
   - Just to keep these isolated let me create a new email account
